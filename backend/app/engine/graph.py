"""
Rule dependency graph + Tarjan SCC cycle detection.

A rule depends on another if:
  - This rule's actions write to entity X / trigger event E
  - Another rule's trigger listens to entity X / event E

We model this as a directed graph: rule_id → [rule_ids that this rule could trigger].
Tarjan SCC identifies cycles (SCCs with size > 1, or self-loops).
